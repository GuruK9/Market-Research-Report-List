**Technological Advancements Driving Center Stack Display Market Expansion**

**Dominance of TFT LCD Technology**

TFT LCD technology commands a substantial portion of the market, holding **81.5% market share as of 2022**. These displays offer:

- High resolution and superior visual clarity
- Lower power consumption
- Lightweight design, ideal for automotive integration

While OLED displays are gaining ground for their richer contrast and flexibility, their adoption remains limited by cost and longevity issues under high-temperature environments.

**Rise of OLED and Flexible Display Integration**

As manufacturers strive for more immersive and customizable user experiences, OLED and flexible displays are anticipated to see increasing penetration post-2025. Their applications will be particularly relevant in luxury and electric vehicles due to:

- Deep blacks and superior contrast
- Thinner and more curved form factors
- Reduced need for backlighting, enabling sleeker designs
