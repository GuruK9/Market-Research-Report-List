**Technology Overview: CCD vs. CMOS**

**Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) Sensors**

While historically favored for their high sensitivity and low noise, CCD sensors are being challenged by advances in CMOS technology. Their higher power consumption and slower readout make them less suitable for real-time, portable applications.

**Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Sensors**

CMOS sensors now lead the industry due to:

- Superior integration capabilities with onboard processing
- Reduced power consumption
- Faster frame rates
- Decreasing cost per unit with each fabrication node shrink

**Key Trend**: Global transition from CCD to CMOS continues across nearly all application domains, accelerated by the demand for high-throughput, high-resolution, and AI-compatible image acquisition systems.

**Medical Image Sensors Market Forecast (2021–2027)**

The global medical image sensors market is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 8.2% through 2027. Growth will be driven by:

- Increasing investments in AI-assisted diagnostics
- Proliferation of portable imaging devices
