**Key Drivers Powering Growth:**	

**Rising E-Commerce Activities**

The exponential rise in e-commerce is a primary catalyst for corrugated carton usage. Businesses require packaging that ensures product integrity during transport and elevates the customer unboxing experience. Corrugated cartons meet these needs with high strength, structural flexibility, and ease of customization.

**Sustainability-Driven Consumer and Regulatory Pressure**

Consumers are increasingly gravitating toward sustainable brands, and governments are intensifying regulations on packaging waste. Corrugated cartons align with both pressures, being recyclable, biodegradable, and suitable for use in circular economies. Companies are adopting these solutions not only for compliance but also as a competitive differentiator.

**Technological Advancements in Packaging**

Advances in packaging design, digital printing, and material science have made corrugated cartons more versatile and efficient. Enhanced print quality through flexographic and digital methods allows companies to deliver branded, personalized packaging at scale. Structural improvements also enable better stacking strength and lighter-weight configurations.
