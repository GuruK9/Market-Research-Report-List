**Technology Segmentation**

**Post-Combustion Capture**

This method captures CO₂ from flue gases after fossil fuel combustion. It is widely applicable to existing power plants and industrial facilities.​

**Pre-Combustion Capture**

Involves gasifying fuel to produce a synthesis gas from which CO₂ is removed before combustion. Commonly used in integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants.​ 

**Oxy-Fuel Combustion**

Burns fuel in pure oxygen, resulting in a flue gas that is primarily CO₂ and water vapor, facilitating easier CO₂ capture.​

**Emerging Technologies**

Innovations such as chemical looping combustion and direct air capture are gaining attention for their potential to enhance CCS efficiency and applicability.
