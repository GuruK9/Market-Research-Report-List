**Key Traditional Radio Advertising Market Growth Drivers**

**Expanding Reach Through Terrestrial Broadcasts**

Terrestrial radio broadcast advertising commands a dominant share of the traditional radio advertising market. Representing **approximately 77% of total market share as of 2021**, terrestrial radio continues to outperform due to its established infrastructure, especially in regions with limited internet access. The sector is projected to grow at a **CAGR of 2.1% through 2028**, supported by the proliferation of FM and AM stations catering to hyperlocal content.

**Sustained Engagement from Automotive Listeners**

In-vehicle radio consumption remains a cornerstone of audience engagement. With increasing vehicle production and ownership, particularly in developing economies, advertisers are leveraging drive-time slots to maximize message recall. Radio’s ability to reach listeners during commutes, where distractions are minimal, enhances its value as a conversion-focused channel.

**Retail Industry's Increased Advertising Spend**

In 2021, the **retail sector accounted for over 17%** of global radio ad expenditures. This surge stems from heightened competition among brands seeking to drive in-store traffic and online conversions.
