**ZLD System Types: Conventional vs Hybrid**

**Conventional ZLD Systems**

Conventional ZLD systems involve well-established technologies like multi-effect evaporators (MEE), crystallizers, and thermal processes. Though capital intensive, they offer proven reliability across high-salinity wastewater applications in power, chemicals, and textile sectors.

**Key Attributes:**

- High energy consumption
- Operationally stable
- Requires significant space and infrastructure

**Hybrid ZLD Systems**

Hybrid ZLD systems integrate membrane technologies (such as RO, NF, and UF) with thermal processes. These systems optimize cost, improve recovery rates, and reduce environmental footprint.

**Key Attributes:**

- Lower energy consumption
- Higher water recovery (up to 98%)
- Compact modular design
- Suited for space-constrained facilities

**Sectoral Applications Driving Demand**

**1. Energy & Power**

Power plants produce large volumes of wastewater with high levels of TDS and heavy metals. ZLD systems are integral to meeting discharge regulations and conserving water.

**Trends**:

- Widespread adoption in coal-fired and combined-cycle plants
- Preference for hybrid solutions to offset thermal energy costs

**2. Electronics and Semiconductor**

Ultrapure water is critical in semiconductor fabrication. ZLD ensures zero discharge of fluoride, heavy metals, and solvents, aligning with stringent environmental norms.

**Key Growth Factor**:
