**Post-Tensioning System Types**

**Bonded Post-Tensioning Systems**

These systems use ducts grouted after tendon installation, offering:

- **Superior Durability**: Reduced susceptibility to corrosion through grout encapsulation.
- **Enhanced Load Transfer**: Greater bonding with the surrounding concrete improves structural integration.
- **Typical Use Cases**: Highways, bridge decks, heavy load-bearing elements.

**Unbonded Post-Tensioning Systems**

Tendons remain ungrouted and free to move within their sheathings, providing:

- **Flexibility in Construction**: Easier adjustments during installation.
- **Lower Initial Costs**: Ideal for slab-on-grade and multi-story buildings.
- **Preferred Applications**: Residential towers, parking garages, commercial floors.

**Industry Applications**

**Buildings**

High-rise and mid-rise structures benefit significantly from post-tensioned slabs, offering thinner floor plates, reduced deflections, and minimized cracking. These benefits translate into faster construction cycles and increased usable space per floor.

**Bridges and Transportation Infrastructure**

Bridge decks and viaducts gain enhanced durability and reduced long-term maintenance through prestressed tendons. Post-tensioned box girders and segmental bridges dominate new bridge construction worldwide due to their load capacity and longer service life.

**Energy Sector**

Hydropower dams, nuclear containment structures, and wind turbine foundations leverage post-tensioning for prestressing massive concrete elements. This technique enhances structural reliability under high-pressure conditions and dynamic loads.

**Entertainment Complexes and Sports Arenas**

Architecturally complex, long-span roofs of stadiums and concert halls utilize post-tensioning to support ambitious design aesthetics with minimal support columns.
