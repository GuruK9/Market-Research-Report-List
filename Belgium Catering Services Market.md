**Healthcare Sector Prioritizing Specialized Nutrition**

The healthcare catering segment is forecasted to grow at 5.9% CAGR, driven by Belgium’s aging population and the rising number of assisted living and rehabilitation centers. Nutrition plays a vital role in patient recovery and long-term care, prompting providers to outsource meal services to catering companies equipped with clinical dietitians and food safety certifications.

There is increasing emphasis on regulatory compliance, such as HACCP and ISO 22000. Tailored menus for diabetic, renal, low-sodium, and allergy-sensitive patients are in high demand. Partnerships with healthcare institutions fuel contract-based recurring revenues.

**Tech Integration & Automation**

Digitalization has emerged as a strategic tool in the Belgian catering ecosystem. From AI-powered kitchen waste management to online ordering platforms, catering companies are embracing technology to enhance transparency, sustainability, and operational precision.

In 2023, Compass Group Belgium partnered with Winnow to introduce AI systems for food waste analysis, resulting in measurable environmental and financial benefits.

**Evolving Consumer Preferences**

There is a growing preference for plant-based meals, locally grown produce, and zero-waste packaging. Flexitarianism and meatless meal alternatives are rising in popularity, particularly in corporate and educational institutions. Vegan, gluten-free, and low-carb options continue to gain traction.

**Shift Toward Experience-Driven Dining**

Experiential catering—such as live cooking stations, interactive menus, and gastro-themed events—is gaining traction. Companies are elevating corporate dining and private events with personalized culinary journeys.

High-end presentation and thematic customization are now value propositions. Hybrid models combining in-person catering and gourmet meal kits for remote teams are emerging.
