**Understanding Power-to-Gas Technology**

Power-to-Gas Market is a transformative technology that enables the conversion of surplus renewable electricity into hydrogen or synthetic natural gas (SNG), which can then be stored and transported through existing infrastructure. The primary advantage of P2G lies in its ability to store energy in a storable form, thereby addressing intermittency challenges associated with renewable energy sources like wind and solar. By converting excess electricity into hydrogen or methane, P2G facilitates the integration of renewable energy into the grid and supports the decarbonization of various sectors, including transportation, industry, and residential energy consumption.

The Power-to-Gas process typically involves:

1. **Electrolysis**: The first step is the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Electrolysis uses electrical energy to split water molecules into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). This hydrogen can then be used as a clean fuel or converted into synthetic methane.
1. **Methanation**: The hydrogen produced is combined with carbon dioxide (CO2) through the methanation process, resulting in synthetic natural gas. This process not only produces a storable form of energy but also offers a pathway to utilize CO2, helping mitigate its impact on climate change.
