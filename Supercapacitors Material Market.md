**Key Material Segments**

**Activated Carbon**

The most widely adopted material in commercial supercapacitors, activated carbon offers a large surface area, cost-efficiency, and stable performance. It is predominantly used in double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), which account for a significant share of total production.

**Graphene**

Graphene-based materials are revolutionizing the supercapacitor landscape due to their exceptional electrical conductivity, high surface area, and mechanical strength. Graphene enables ultrafast charging capabilities and is a core material for hybrid capacitors.

**Carbon Aerogels**

Carbon aerogels exhibit ultra-low density, high porosity, and impressive thermal conductivity. Their applications are expanding in both double-layer capacitors and hybrid systems.

**Metal Oxides**

Metal oxides like MnO₂, RuO₂, and NiO are pivotal in pseudocapacitors, where faradaic redox reactions contribute to high energy density. These materials offer superior capacitance compared to carbon-based alternatives, albeit at a higher cost.

**Conductive Polymers**

Materials such as polyaniline and polypyrrole are used in flexible, lightweight devices. These polymers enable high conductivity and can be tailored to suit specialized applications in medical electronics and lightweight wearables.

**Application Landscape**

**Double Layer Capacitors (EDLCs)**

These are widely used in automotive electronics, memory backup systems, and renewable energy systems. They leverage activated carbon and graphene to achieve high capacitance and excellent cycle life.

**Pseudocapacitors**

With higher energy density than EDLCs, pseudocapacitors are well-suited for military and aerospace applications. Their growth is primarily driven by the development of advanced metal oxide and polymer materials.
