**The Strategic Role of Dissolution Testing in Drug Development**

Dissolution testing has become indispensable to modern drug development and regulatory compliance. It quantifies the **rate and extent to which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)** is released from solid dosage forms and becomes available for absorption. The **FDA**, **EMA**, and other global regulatory bodies mandate dissolution testing across the product lifecycle—from formulation to batch release.

**Key Testing Modalities:**

- Paddle and Basket Apparatus (USP Apparatus 1 & 2)
- Flow-Through Cells (USP Apparatus 4)
- Reciprocating Cylinder and Disc (Apparatus 3 & 5)
- In-vitro Simulated Gastrointestinal Models
