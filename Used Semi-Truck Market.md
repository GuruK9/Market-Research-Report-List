## <a name="_idqjlsx7f2yx"></a>**Fuel Type Analysis: Diesel, Petrol, and the Transition to Electric**
### <a name="_ssqna06kni74"></a>**Diesel-Powered Trucks**
Diesel remains the backbone of the commercial transportation ecosystem. With superior torque and fuel efficiency, diesel trucks are the go-to choice for heavy-duty and long-distance operations. Despite tightening emission regulations, the resale value of diesel trucks remains robust due to proven reliability and performance.
### <a name="_w5deicamr36"></a>**Petrol Trucks**
Petrol trucks are more prevalent in the light- to medium-duty segment. Their lower upfront cost and maintenance simplicity make them viable in short-haul environments and specific regional markets with limited diesel infrastructure.
### <a name="_7htkt0b18wz6"></a>**Electric Used Trucks**
Though still emerging, the secondary market for electric semi-trucks is expanding. Advancements in battery technology and increasing environmental regulations are accelerating adoption. As more fleets electrify, the resale of early-generation electric semi-trucks will gain momentum—particularly in Europe and North America.

## <a name="_guepdoxatpfu"></a>**Sales Channel Dynamics**
### <a name="_bl7y92h8mp01"></a>**Franchised Dealers**
Operating under brand-authorized frameworks, franchised dealers offer structured transactions, quality assurance, and access to certified pre-owned programs. Their role is crucial in markets with high compliance standards and buyer scrutiny.
### <a name="_v1bt3g71mpgf"></a>**Independent Dealers**
These entities cater to price-sensitive buyers, offering a broader inventory and more negotiation flexibility. Their prominence is rising in developing regions where informal sales ecosystems are common.
### <a name="_th8vk5gofec2"></a>**Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces**
Digital transformation has enabled peer-to-peer platforms to flourish. Businesses and individuals can now transact directly, benefiting from lower costs. However, risk mitigation through inspections and third-party audits is vital to sustain trust in this model.

## <a name="_nxcmpoy91cdq"></a>**Propulsion Type Outlook: ICE vs. Electric**
The dominance of internal combustion engine (ICE) semi-trucks persists, particularly in regions lacking widespread EV infrastructure. However, as electric charging networks expand and ESG mandates tighten, electric semi-trucks—especially those from legacy OEMs entering the second ownership cycle—are carving a space in the resale market.
