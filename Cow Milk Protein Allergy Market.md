**IgE-Mediated Allergies Lead Global Diagnosis Trends**

**Dominance of IgE-Mediated CMPA**

IgE-mediated CMPA remains the most prevalent form globally, characterized by an immediate immune reaction upon ingestion of cow’s milk proteins. This type is easily identifiable through **skin prick tests or IgE blood assays**, with symptoms like **hives, vomiting, wheezing, or anaphylaxis** appearing rapidly. The clear clinical presentation facilitates quicker diagnosis and treatment, driving market adoption.

**Rising Detection of Non-IgE Mediated CMPA**

Non-IgE mediated CMPA, which triggers delayed gastrointestinal symptoms, represents the **fastest-growing segment**. Previously underdiagnosed due to its subtle presentation, advancements in **non-invasive diagnostics and biomarker research** are now improving detection rates, propelling market expansion.

**Hypoallergenic Formulas Transforming Treatment Approaches**

**Extensively Hydrolyzed Formulas (eHFs) Maintain Market Leadership**

eHFs are the **primary choice** for managing moderate CMPA cases. By enzymatically breaking down milk proteins into smaller peptides, these formulas minimize allergic reactions. Their widespread availability, affordability, and proven effectiveness solidify their dominance in the market.

**Amino Acid-Based Formulas (AAFs) Show Rapid Growth**

AAFs, composed of free amino acids, are **completely non-allergenic** and ideal for infants with severe or persistent CMPA. With a projected **CAGR of 8.3% (2025-2032)**, AAFs are gaining traction due to **improved taste, digestibility, and increasing healthcare reimbursement support**.

**Age-Based Market Segmentation: Infants Lead, Toddlers Gain Momentum**
